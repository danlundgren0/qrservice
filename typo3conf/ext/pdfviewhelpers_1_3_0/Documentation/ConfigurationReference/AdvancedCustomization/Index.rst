Advanced Customization
----------------------

You can add custom headers and footers to all pages by providing your own TCPDF class. The more you can customize TCPDF
in any way you like using your own class.

*See plugin.tx_pdfviewhelpers.settings.config.class*

If there is a ViewHelper missing, feel free to implement your own ViewHelper extending the AbstractPDFViewHelper from the extension.
You can have a look at the ViewHelpers in *Classes/ViewHelpers*. If you feel like your ViewHelper might be useful for everybody, feel free to create a pull request!
